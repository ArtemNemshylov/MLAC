## About the Course

The course consists of a series of lessons, each requiring you to write a Python class that implements a specific machine learning algorithm. Each lesson is accompanied by the necessary theory to help you understand the basics of each algorithm.

The implementation of each algorithm follows a step-by-step approach: with each step, you will expand the functionality of your model. You are required to copy and extend the code written in previous steps with new functionality.

It is recommended to follow the course sequentially, from start to finish. This will help solidify your understanding of the material and track the evolution of each algorithm from simple to more complex.

## Getting Help

If you encounter any questions or difficulties during the course, feel free to ask in the code comments. Other students, as well as the course author, can provide assistance.
